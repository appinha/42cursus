## üó£Ô∏è About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology:
	no teachers, no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to
	peer learning), with a methodology that develops both computing and life skills.
	The 42 cursus is free for whoever is approved in its selection process* - the
	so-called "Piscine" - becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).

\* For further information about 42's **selection process** (the "Piscine"), please visit the [C Piscine repo](https://github.com/appinha/42sp-piscine).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills developed at 42cursus

### Hard-skills

	* C/C++ language, Makefile

	* Git
	* Networks
	* Docker
	* SQL
	* Web (HTML, CSS, Wordpress)
	* Computer graphics
	* Assembly language

-- among others (find below the complete [curriculum](#42s-galaxy-curriculum)).

### Soft-skills

	# Self-learning and proactivity
		At 42, self-learning is at the core of its peer to peer learning methodology. There
		are no teachers whatsoever; the learning process is based on googling, enquiring
		your classmates, and empirical knowledge, each student learning at their own pace.

	# Teamwork
		Some projects must or should be developed in groups, which promotes collaborative
		work among cadets. The major challenge here is to equalize the different knowledge
		levels while finding a common work methodology that allows all team members to
		contribute to the project.

	# Time management and resiliency
		The school is open 24/7. Thus, the cadets are free to work whenever they want, which
		demands excellent time management skills and resiliency for not "drowning" amid the
		massive load of work demanded by the program.

## üåå 42's galaxy (curriculum)

The 42cursus comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as "inner circle" and the second one, "outer treks" - due to the Holy Graph layout (see image below). The "inner circle" is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange. The "outer treks" are a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development that allows cadets to specialize in such subjects.

The table below presents the cursus' curriculum in the chronological order in which it was (or is to be) completed by me - projects order and corresponding attained level may vary among students.
